# Health Ledger [WIP]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anaskhan96/HealthLedger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anaskhan96/HealthLedger)

*HealthLedger* stores all your medical records, which you can view as a patient, and your doctor(s) can edit them. It's a tool built with the view of making lives easier for both patients and doctors. Everytime a patient goes to see a doctor, all he has to do is open up his *HealthLedger* profile, and the doctor can accurately depict what's wrong and what treatment should be offered, instead of depending upon the patient's vague description.

A particular instance of such a profile would include sections like Medical History, Allergen, Insurance Policy, Treatment, Diseases, and more. Some miscellaneous hospital details have also been provided incase the patient's admitted in a particular hospital.

*HealthLedger* is but a small web app, demonstrating how a tool like this might look if implemented.
